# Credit Card Fraud Model (R / caret)

An R-based supervised machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction-level features.

Dataset: Kaggle (uploaded by Dhanush Narayanan R)  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud

## Repository contents
- `classifier.R` — main script that loads data, preprocesses features, trains the model, evaluates performance, and visualizes results.

## Authorship & integrity
This project was independently designed and implemented by me.

All data preparation, feature handling, model training, tuning, and evaluation were performed independently.  
This project was **not** created by following a step-by-step tutorial or replicating a prescribed assignment solution.

External libraries and tools were used only as development aids and are listed below.

## High-level approach
The model pipeline:
1. Loads the credit card transaction dataset from a local CSV file
2. Performs preprocessing required for modeling
3. Trains a classification model using the `caret` framework
4. Evaluates performance on a held-out test set
5. Outputs visualizations and a confusion matrix for analysis

## Setup

### Requirements
- R (recommended version: R 4.x)
- R packages:
  - `caret`
  - `ggplot2`

Install required packages:
```r
install.packages(c("caret", "ggplot2"))
````

## How to run

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:
   [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud)
2. Open `classifier.R`
3. Update the dataset file path where the CSV is loaded
4. Run the script:

   * In RStudio: open `classifier.R` and click **Source**
   * Or via terminal:
       Rscript classifier.R

## Outputs

* Model training and evaluation logs
* Variable visualizations
* Confusion matrix summarizing classification performance

## Notes & limitations

* The dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud cases are rare), so accuracy alone is not a reliable metric.
* Precision, recall, and the confusion matrix should be emphasized when evaluating results.
* This model is intended as an experimental and educational implementation, not a production system.

## Tools & libraries

* R
* `caret`
* `ggplot2`

### Assistive tools

* ChatGPT, Cursor, and Stack Overflow were used for debugging and error interpretation.
* No autogenerated code was used without modification.

## Project status

The project is functional but open to further improvement, such as experimenting with alternative models, improved handling of class imbalance, and more robust evaluation metrics.
