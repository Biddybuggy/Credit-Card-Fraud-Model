Notes:
1. The code will train and test the ML model, visualize the data of the dataset's variables, and print out a confusion matrix.
2. Libraries such as Caret and ggplot2 will need to be downloaded beforehand.
3. The path to the dataset should be inserted in the fifth line of the code (where it says 'path'). The file to the dataset is provided in this repository.
