# Credit-Card-Fraud-Model
This is my Columbia University Pre-College Programs final project (course: Big Data, Machine Learning, and Their Real World Applications BIGDPS0104). It aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and utilizes a Kaggle dataset uploaded by Dhanush Narayanan R (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud).
